# HomeWork #22

Here you will find a react application created with create-react-app. You don't have to style it, but if you want to change something you are welcome.

## What you need to do?

There are 2 components, `Header` and `Comment`. Add them to the `App.js`.

1. `Header` have a title, so make sure to send the right prop;
2. `Comment` needs also 3 props to show: `author`, `text` and `date`. You can use the `comment` constant from `App.js`;
3. Add 3 more `Comment` components with different authors and text;

### Some Hints:

1. After downloading the repo, don't forget to install the dependencies with `npm install`;
2. You can run the application using the command `npm start`, from the app folder;
3. Take a look at the styles and how they are included;
4. Take a look at `formatDate` function and where it was declared;
5. I have added some comments in `App.js` where to put the components;
